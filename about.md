Greetings,

My name is Jae, a machine learning enthusiast and practitioner. This is a little corner of the internet where I write about various topics related to machine learning, probabilitics methods and uncertainty.

While I aim to explain ideas clearly, it is possible for my wording to be confusing or even outright erroneous. If you observe such case, please get in touch with me and I will try to rectify the mistake.

This blog is open source. The code is [here](https://github.com/agiantwhale/sparsedata). Feel free to submit a pull request if you see potential improvements.
